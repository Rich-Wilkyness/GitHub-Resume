This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

-'Journal' - A place where an individual can create a journal, add entries, save, and load a .txt file of journal.
-'Memorizer' - This is a program that slowly removes words from a string but can retrieve a hint of a specific spot you may have forgotten a word.
-'Meditation' - practice inheritance in classes, three different meditation activities as children of activity
