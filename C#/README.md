This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

-'Journal' - A place where an individual can create a journal, add entries, save, and load a .txt file of journal.
-'Memorizer' - This is a program that slowly removes words from a string but can retrieve a hint of a specific spot you may have forgotten a word.
-'Meditation' - practice inheritance in classes, three different meditation activities as children of activity

- 'InovatorsGithub' - Team project that uses C# Blazor server and Bootstrap. Features include User registration and login, user profile, and user blog posts.

- I will not list them, but have also completed many of the C# learning paths on the [Microsoft website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?products=dotnet&resource_type=learning%20path), which were uploaded to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/rChristianWilkerson/_git/CSE%20325) and [Blazing Pizza](https://dev.azure.com/rChristianWilkerson/CSE%20325/_git/BlazingPizza)
